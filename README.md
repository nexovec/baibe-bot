The goal of this fork is to demonstrate how to unit test your [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) bot with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and to serve as a starting point for those who want to do the same.

## How to run

Set up your credentials in screeps.json, run `npm run push-pserver` or `npm run push-main`
